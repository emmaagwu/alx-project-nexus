## Project Overview
The **ProDev Backend Engineering** program focuses on practical backend engineering skills: building reliable server-side applications, designing data models, implementing APIs, containerizing and deploying services, and adding automation with CI/CD. This repository collects the most important lessons, patterns, and artifacts I produced during the program so future employers or collaborators can quickly review my knowledge and projects.

---

## Repository Purpose
- Serve as a single source of truth for what I learned in the program.
- Host mini-projects, architecture notes, design decisions, and troubleshooting logs.
- Provide reproducible examples (Docker, CI, migrations) that demonstrate real-world backend workflows.
- Showcase a growth record: problems I faced, how I debugged them, and what I’d do differently next time.

## How to Use This Repo
- `docs/` — deep-dive notes, diagrams, decision logs.
- `projects/` — small projects and labs (one folder per project).
- `snippets/` — useful code snippets and templates (Dockerfiles, workflow YAMLs, DB schema templates).
- `diagrams/` — architecture diagrams (PNG/SVG).
- `notes/` — quick lessons, gotchas, and interview prep questions.
- `README.md` — this file.
